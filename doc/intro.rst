Introduction
========================================================================

SrXes provides a simple and interactive way to visualize and interact with 
X-ray Diffraction data. SrXes provides an intuitive user interface to load
up data and perform calculations from it. The concept of the reduced 
representation allows users to analyze large data sets rapidly and efficiently.A reduced representation maps an entire image to a single number, and can
be any piece of information about the image, eg. the mean intensity.
This allows for absolute control by the user and fast quality assessment
of large data sets.
